 If this operation immediately follows an `AddShapeOperation` for the exact
 same text shape, and `originalText` is empty, then this operation declines to
 be added to the undo stack and instead causes the `AddShapeOperation` to simply
 add the shape with the new text value. This means that we avoid having an
 "add empty text shape" operation in the undo stack.
