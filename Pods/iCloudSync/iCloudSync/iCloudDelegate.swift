     Sent to the delegate where there is a conflict between a local file and an iCloud file during an upload or download
 
     When both files have the same modification date and file content, iCloud Document Sync will not be able to automatically determine how to handle the conflict. As a result, this delegate method is called to pass the file information to the delegate which should be able to appropriately handle and resolve the conflict. The delegate should, if needed, present the user with a conflict resolution interface. iCloud Document Sync does not need to know the result of the attempted resolution, it will continue to upload all files which are not conflicting.
     
     It is important to note that **this method may be called more than once in a very short period of time** - be prepared to handle the data appropriately.
     
     The delegate is only notified about conflicts during upload and download procedures with iCloud. This method does not monitor for document conflicts between documents which already exist in iCloud. There are other methods provided to you to detect document state and state changes / conflicts.
 
     - Parameter cloudFile: Dictionary with the cloud file and various other information. This parameter contains the fileContent as NSData, fileURL as NSURL, and modifiedDate as NSDate.
     - Parameter localFile: Dictionary with the local file and various other information. This parameter contains the fileContent as NSData, fileURL as NSURL, and modifiedDate as NSDate.
